When you subscribe to Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) and connect to and use our cloud-based apps and services, you'll manage a ~~CDF~~ **organization**. An organization is a collection of ~~CDF~~ **projects**. The data in one project is **completely isolated** from the data in other projects.

Depending on your existing infrastructure and needs, you decide which **cluster** to run your ~~CDF~~ organization in. A cluster determines which **cloud provider** to use — Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Each provider has [different clusters](/cdf/admin/clusters_regions#cognite-multi-tenant-clusters) to store data in your preferred **region**, such as North America, Asia, or Europe.

Also, you can choose between a **multi-tenant** or a **dedicated** cluster:

* In a **multi-tenant** cluster, you share cloud storage and computing resources with other Cognite tenants.

* In a **dedicated** cluster, your organization uses cloud storage and computing resources exclusively. To request a dedicated cluster, contact your Cognite representative.

You can configure your organization to use your existing **identity provider (IdP)** — for example, Microsoft Entra ID, Amazon Cognito, or Auth0 — to manage access to your CDF projects. Only users registered in your IdP can sign in to the organization and the projects.
