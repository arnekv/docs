~~Cognite Data Fusion~~ (~~CDF~~) streams your industrial data into a data model. You can add connections between different types of data automatically and manually and store the information in a [**knowledge graph**](/cdf/dm/) in the cloud. With your data in the cloud, you can use the CDF services and tools to build solutions and applications to meet your business needs.

With Cognite, **you** own your data. We use it only to provide agreed-upon services, handle it [**securely**](/cdf/trust/security/), and comply with **privacy** and **legal regulations**. If you leave our services, we ensure you continue to own your data.

You can interact with your data through dedicated workspaces in the ~~CDF~~ **web application** or with our [**APIs**](https://developer.cognite.com/api/) and [**SDKs**](https://developer.cognite.com/sdks/).
