# Introduction to the Python Data Modeling SDK Generator, Pygen


Pygen is a python package and a command-line interface (`pygen`) used for generating Python SDKs from Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) data models.

It can be used for different purposes:

1. As an **exploration tool** to discover existing data models and the data in them. This is the typical way to use the tool for development and iterations on a development project.
2. For **building solutions** on top of data models. It gives a common interface to work with data models in Python for 
   a developer or developer team.
3. For **data population** of data models. It can be used to populate data models with data from other sources.

For more information, see the [Where to Start](https://cognite-pygen.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/quickstart/where_to_start.html) 
section in the documentation.
