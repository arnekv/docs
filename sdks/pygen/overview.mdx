Pygen is a Python package and a command-line interface (`pygen`) used for generating Python SDKs from Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) data models.

It can be used for different purposes:

- As an **exploration tool** to discover existing data models and the data in them. This is the typical way to use the tool for development and iterations on a development project.
- For **building solutions** on top of data models. It gives a common interface to work with data models in Python for 
   a developer or developer team.
- For **data population** of data models. It can be used to populate data models with data from other sources.
