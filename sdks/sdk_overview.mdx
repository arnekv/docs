title: "SDKs and toolkits overview"
description: "Overview of Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) SDKs and toolkits, including general, specialized, and industry SDKs, as well as supported languages and tools."
---

Not all our SDKs have the same functionality, and they expose functionality differently. We have three types of SDKs:

- [**General**](#general-sdks) SDKs for interacting with the Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) APIs.

- [**Specialized**](#specialized-sdks) SDKs that offer a tailored experience for specific tasks or areas.

- [**Industry**](#industry-sdks) SDKs that expose industry-specific functionality.

The general Python and JavaScript SDKs for CDF are primarily for backend and frontend work, respectively. The Python SDK is also used from the Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit-powered web experiences, and the JavaScript SDK is used from Node.js.

We also offer [**toolkits**](#toolkits) for setting up and handling CDF projects, as well as for creating extractors to import data into CDF.

## Support and maintenance

The general [**Python**](sdks/python/index.md) and [**JavaScript**](sdks/js/index.md) SDKs for CDF are **supported** by Cognite.

Other SDKs and toolkits are actively developed and are **community-supported** with contributions from Cognite engineers. They are provided **as-is**, without any support or warranties from Cognite.
