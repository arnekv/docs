description: "Overview of Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) SDKs and toolkits, including general, specialized, and industry SDKs, as well as supported languages and tools."
---

The SDKs and toolkits are designed to help you work with CDF more effectively, whether you're building applications, integrating data, or developing custom solutions.

## Support and maintenance

The general [**Python**](sdks/python/index.md) and [**JavaScript**](sdks/js/index.md) SDKs for CDF are **supported** by Cognite.

<Warning>
Other SDKs and toolkits are actively developed and are **community-supported** with contributions from Cognite engineers. They are provided **as-is**, without any support or warranties from Cognite.
