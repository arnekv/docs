title: Tutorial guidance
description: Tutorials help people learn about products and solve real world problems by guiding them through the entire workflow to complete a task.

Tutorials are more conversational in tone than other content. A tutorial feels like a engineer-to-engineer conversation while remaining accessible to readers with varied technical knowledge.

Tutorials are for people who want expert advice and a detailed discussion of best practices related to their problem. Tutorials also help people who've implemented similar solutions in the past with other products. Tutorials can also help people validate whether the solution is appropriate for their needs.

## How to write a tutorial

Contents of tutorials:

* Introduction
  * Clarifies audience.
  * Clearly states prerequisites and prior knowledge needed.
  * States what someone will accomplish or build.
  * Includes an example of a successful project.
  * Does not include the expected amount of time that it may take someone to complete the task - this depends on the experience level of the person completing the tutorial.

* Procedural sections
  * Based on the tutorial's audience, the steps can be less explicit and formal than those used in procedural content.
  * Link out to other articles or resources rather than replicating them, to avoid interrupting the flow of information in the tutorial.
  * Give visual cues. Use code blocks and screenshots heavily to help reassure people that they are performing the correct actions.
  * Provide real examples.

* Troubleshooting
  * Acknowledge what may go wrong in the task and list a few common problems readers might run into with solutions.
* Conclusion
  * Review what was accomplished or built. Refer back to the project provided in the introduction as an example of a successful project.
* Next steps
  * Include 2-3 actionable next steps that someone can take after completing the tutorial. Link off to other related information like:
    * Projects that illustrate the introduced concepts
    * Relevant information on docs.cognite.com
    * Relevant Academy content or Hub posts.

## Title guidelines for tutorials

* Do not use "tutorial" or "guide" in the title.
