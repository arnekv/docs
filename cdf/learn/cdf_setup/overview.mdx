To follow the tutorial, familiarity with cloud concepts and basic knowledge of data management will be helpful.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional CDF project that can be used to manage and analyze your data. You will create a project similar to the [Cognite Data Fusion Sample Project](https://example.com).

<Steps>
<Step title="Get a CDF project">

    To get started, you need a Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) project.

    If you already have a CDF project, you can skip this step. To register for a CDF project.

## Get access to publicdata

When you sign up for the Cognite Hub, you get access to public data sets that can be used in your CDF project. The data originates from a single compressor on Aker BPâ€™s Valhall oil platform:

1. Go to the [Cognite Hub](https://hub.cognite.com) and [sign up](https://hub.cognite.com/welcome-to-cognite-hub-73/how-to-sign-up-for-cognite-hub-and-cognite-academy-617).

You can learn more about the public data sets in the [Open Industrial Data](https://hub.cognite.com/open-industrial-data-211) section of the Cognite Hub.

## Configure your identity provider (IdP)

To allow apps and users to sign in to Cognite Data Fusion with their organizational ID, configure your identity provider (IdP):

- <https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_deploy/cdf_deploy_access_management>

## Allowlist URLs on your firewall

To load user interfaces correctly:

1. Add these URLs to your allowlist: [Allowlist URLs](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/admin/allowlist)

## Step 2: Deploy with the Cognite Toolkit

Prerequisites for this step include: A recent version of Python, at minimum v3.10.
Recommended: a virtual environment manager like Poetry or pyenv for Python versions and dependencies.
Recommended: Basic knowledge of Git.
