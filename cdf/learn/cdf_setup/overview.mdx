To follow the tutorial, familiarity with cloud concepts and basic knowledge of data management will be helpful.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional CDF project that can be used to manage and analyze your data. You will create a project similar to the [Cognite Data Fusion Sample Project](https://example.com).

## Step 1: Get a CDF project and set up the basic configuration

To get started, you need a Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) project. If you don't have a CDF project yet, you can sign up for a free trial or contact your Cognite representative to get access.

<Steps>

<Step title="Get a CDF project and gain access to public data sets">

 1. Navigate to the [Cognite Data Fusion registration page](https://example.com).
 2. Fill in the required information, including your name, email address, and organization.
 3. Select [the region and cluster](/cdf/admin/clusters_regions) for your project.
 4. Click "Register" to submit your request.
 5. Optional: Go to the [Cognite Hub](https://hub.cognite.com) and [sign up](https://hub.cognite.com/welcome-to-cognite-hub-73/how-to-sign-up-for-cognite-hub-and-cognite-academy-617) to get access to the public data sets.

 6. Learn more about the public data sets in the [Open Industrial Data](https://hub.cognite.com/open-industrial-data-211) section of the Cognite Hub.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your identity provider (IdP) and the firewall allowlist">

Once your project is created, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access it.

1. Sign in to your CDF project using the credentials provided in the email.
2. Follow the instructions in the [Access Management documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_deploy/cdf_deploy_access_management) to configure your identity provider (IdP).

    This step is essential for allowing apps and users to sign in to Cognite Data Fusion with their organizational ID.
3. Add [these URLs](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/admin/allowlist) to your allowlist to ensure that user interfaces load correctly.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Deploy with the Cognite Toolkit

Before you begin this step, make sure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.10 or later) installed on your system.
- (Recommended) A virtual environment manager such as Poetry or pyenv to manage Python versions and dependencies.
- (Recommended) Basic familiarity with Git for version control.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Cognite Toolkit">
    1. Follow the steps in the [Setting up the Cognite Toolkit](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_toolkit/guides/setup) article to install the Cognite Toolkit and the basic file structure on your computer and prepare the configuration for integration with version control repository.
    2. Set up authentication and authorization for Cognite Toolkit by following the instructions in the [Authentication documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_toolkit/guides/auth).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure, build, and deploy modules">
    1. Follow the steps in the [Setting up the Cognite Toolkit](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_toolkit/guides/setup) article to install the Cognite Toolkit and the basic file structure on your computer and prepare the configuration for integration with version control repository.
    1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
    1. Run the command `cognite init` to initialize a new CDF project.
    1. Follow the prompts to configure your project, including setting the project name, description, and region.
