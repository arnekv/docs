## Filter and sort your search results[​](#filter-and-sort-your-search-results "Direct link to heading")

To help you find exactly what you need, you can filter and sort your search results.

## Create search filters with AI *[(beta)](/cdf/product_feature_status)*[​](#create-search-filters-with-ai-beta "Direct link to heading")

<Warning>
  We are deprecating this feature. Retired date is set to June 4, 2025.
</Warning>

Use AI to create and apply search filters for your questions (prompts).

In the ***Industrial tools*\_** workspace, navigate to the ***Home*** page or the ***Search*** tool:

1. Click the ***Search*** field, type your question, and select ***Navigate categories and filters using AI*** in the drop-down menu.

   AI creates filters to return results that answer your question.

2. If the results aren't accurate, rewrite the question or fine-tune or add new [filters](#filter-and-sort-your-search-results) to refine your search results.

## Not finding what you're looking for?[​](#not-finding-what-you're-looking-for "Direct link to heading")

Check your spelling and make sure you've selected the correct [location](#filter-and-sort-your-search-results).

You'll only see items that you have access to. Verify with your internal help desk or the CDF admin that you have access to the data you're looking for.
