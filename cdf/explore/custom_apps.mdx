Custom apps are applications tailored to your organization's needs and requirements. Your organization develops and maintains these applications, and you need to contact your local admin for help.

If you don't see any applications on the ***Custom app*** page, there are no custom apps available within your organization, or you don't have the necessary capabilities to access the apps.
