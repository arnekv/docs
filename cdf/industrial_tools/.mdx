Use the sidebar to navigate the workspace.

➀ ***Home*** — go to the main workspace page to search or resume your activity.

➁ **Collapse/expand** — click the icon to collapse (**\<\<**) or expand (**>>**) the sidebar, for example, to free up extra space while you're viewing a chart.

➂ **Switch workspace** — to switch to a different workspace, click the **Industrial tools** workspace name and then a workspace from the menu.

➃ **Switch project** — to switch to a different project, click the **project** name and then a project from the menu.

➄ **Tools** — select an industrial tool to **find** or **analyze** data.

### ***Search***[​](#search "Direct link to heading")

To find what you're looking for, enter your query in the **search** field or let **AI** suggest and apply the right categories and filters. Search returns data that matches your query. If you find a pump, you'll also find associated assets, documents, sensor data, and engineering diagrams. [Learn more](/cdf/explore/search).

### ***Canvas***[​](#canvas "Direct link to heading")

Visualize and explore all types of data from your ~~CDF~~ project, for example, to do root-cause analysis. Summarize results, leave comments, and share and collaborate with your coworkers. [Learn more](/cdf/explore/canvas).

### ***Charts***[​](#charts "Direct link to heading")

Explore, trend, and analyze time series. Find data using contextualized engineering diagrams and create template charts with pre-selected time series and calculations to troubleshoot or perform root-cause analysis. [Learn more](/cdf/charts/).

### Apps[​](#apps "Direct link to heading")

Custom apps are tailored to your organization's needs and requirements. Your organization develops and maintains these applications. If you don't see any, there are no custom apps available within your organization, or you don't have the necessary access rights. [Learn more](/cdf/explore/custom_apps).

### Agents[​](#agents "Direct link to heading")

Select an Atlas agent that uses AI to help you find data. If you don't see any agents, there are none available within your organization. [Learn more](/cdf/explore/agents).
