Cognite Atlas AI extends Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) with a workspace to create and manage industrial AI agents that can help solve your specific business needs. Cognite provides example agent templates that you can use as a starting point for building your agents, or you can use our low-code tools to create agents from scratch.

AI agents use generative AI (genAI) [language models](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) and include prompts with instructions and goals, industry-relevant [tools](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_tools), and access to industrial data stored in your CDF [knowledge graph](/cdf/dm/). Humans set the goals, and the AI agent chooses the best actions to take to achieve those goals.
