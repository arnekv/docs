Iterate rapidly with the **_Agent builder_** chat preview. When you're satisfied with the agent's performance, publish it and make it available in the **_Agent library_** to all users in the CDF project.

## Before you start[​](#before-you-start)

Before you start building the agent, scope your use case, identify an evaluation data set, and choose the [language model](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) to start with.

## Build and publish an agent[​](#build-an-publish-an-agent)

To build and publish an Atlas AI agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the agent.">
    1. Navigate to **_Atlas AI_** \> **_Agent builder_**.
    2. Select **_\+ Create agent_** or select a template to use as a starting point.
    3. Enter a **_Name_** for the agent.
    4. Enter a **_Description_** to help users understand what they can use the agent for, for example, which problems the agent can help solve or which tasks it can automate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the prompts.">
    1. Enter one or more **_Sample prompts_** to display as examples to users when they interact with the agent.
    2. In the **_Prompting_** section:
       1. Select the [**_Language model_**](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) you have identified as the best fit for your agent.
       2. Provide **_Instructions_** with specific directives or guidelines for **how** the agent should achieve the goals.

          For more details, see [Prompts and prompt engineering](/cdf/atlas_ai/concepts/overview.mdx#prompts-and-prompt-engineering).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add tools.">
    1. Add [**_Tools_**](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_tools) to allow the agent to access data in the CDF knowledge graph, perform more complex tasks, or interact with other applications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and refine.">
    1. Use the chat interface to **test** the agent.
    2. To **refine** the agent, adjust the language model, instructions, and tools as necessary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and monitor.">
    1. Select **_Publish_** to make the agent available in the **_Agent library_** to all users in the CDF project.
    2. **Monitor** the performance and effectiveness of the agent and make ongoing improvements.
  </Step>
</Steps>
