<Warning>
  The features described in this section are currently available to **early adopters** only and are subject to change.
</Warning>

Build and publish Atlas AI agents to solve business problems or automate workflows using the low-code ***Agent builder***. You can build your agent from scratch, or select an out-of-the-box template as a starting point.

Iterate rapidly with the ***Agent builder*** chat preview. When you're satisfied with the agent's performance, publish it and make it available in the ***Agent library*** to all users in the CDF project.

## Before you start[​](#before-you-start "Direct link to heading")

Before you start building the agent, scope your use case, identify an evaluation data set, and choose the [language model](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) to start with.

## Build an publish an agent[​](#build-an-publish-an-agent "Direct link to heading")

To build and publish an Atlas AI agent:

1. Navigate to ***Atlas AI*** > ***Agent builder***.

2. Select ***+ Create agent*** or select a template to use as a starting point.

3. Enter a ***Name*** for the agent.

4. Enter a ***Description*** to help users understand what they can use the agent for, for example, which problems the agent can help solve or which tasks it can automate.

5. Enter one or more ***Sample prompts*** to display as examples to users when they interact with the agent.

6. In the ***Prompting*** section:

   1. Select the [***Language model***](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) you have identified as the best fit for your agent.

   2. Specify ***Goals*** to define the desired outcomes or objectives of the interactions with the agent. Goals outline **what** you want to accomplish.

   3. Provide ***Instructions*** with specific directives or guidelines for **how** the agent should achieve the goals.

      See [Prompts and prompt engineering](/cdf/atlas_ai/concepts/#prompts-and-prompt-engineering) for more details.

7. Add [***Tools***](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_tools) to allow the agent to access data in the CDF knowledge graph, perform more complex tasks, or interact with other applications.

8. Use the chat interface to **test** the agent. To **refine** the agent, adjust the language model, goals, instructions, and tools as necessary.

9. Select ***Publish*** to make the agent available in the ***Agent library*** to all users in the CDF project.

10. **Monitor** the performance and effectiveness of the agent and make ongoing improvements.
