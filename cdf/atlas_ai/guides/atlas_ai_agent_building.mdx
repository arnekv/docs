<Warning>
  The features described in this section are currently available to **early adopters** only and are subject to change.
</Warning>

Build and publish Atlas AI agents to solve business problems or automate workflows using the low-code **_Agent builder_**. You can build your agent from scratch, or select an out-of-the-box template as a starting point.

Iterate rapidly with the **_Agent builder_** chat preview. When you're satisfied with the agent's performance, publish it and make it available in the **_Agent library_** to all users in the CDF project.

## Before you start[​](#before-you-start)

Before you start building the agent, scope your use case, identify an evaluation data set, and choose the [language model](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) to start with.

## Build and publish an agent[​](#build-an-publish-an-agent)

To build and publish an Atlas AI agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Atlas AI > Agent builder.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select + Create agent or select a template to use as a starting point.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter a Name for the agent.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter a Description to help users understand what they can use the agent for, for example, which problems the agent can help solve or which tasks it can automate.">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

 1. Navigate to **_Atlas AI_** \> **_Agent builder_**.
 2. Select **_\+ Create agent_** or select a template to use as a starting point.
 3. Enter a **_Name_** for the agent.
 4. Enter a **_Description_** to help users understand what they can use the agent for, for example, which problems the agent can help solve or which tasks it can automate.
 5. Enter one or more **_Sample prompts_** to display as examples to users when they interact with the agent.
 6. In the **_Prompting_** section:
    1. Select the [**_Language model_**](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_language_models) you have identified as the best fit for your agent.
    2. Specify **_Goals_** to define the desired outcomes or objectives of the interactions with the agent. Goals outline **what** you want to accomplish.
    3. Provide **_Instructions_** with specific directives or guidelines for **how** the agent should achieve the goals.

       See [Prompts and prompt engineering](/cdf/atlas_ai/concepts/#prompts-and-prompt-engineering) for more details.
 7. Add [**_Tools_**](/cdf/atlas_ai/references/atlas_ai_agent_tools) to allow the agent to access data in the CDF knowledge graph, perform more complex tasks, or interact with other applications.
 8. Use the chat interface to **test** the agent. To **refine** the agent, adjust the language model, goals, instructions, and tools as necessary.
 9. Select **_Publish_** to make the agent available in the **_Agent library_** to all users in the CDF project.
10. **Monitor** the performance and effectiveness of the agent and make ongoing improvements.
