Authentication is the process of validating claims of identity, and is the first half of establishing whether a user is a user in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) and what they should have access to.

Requests to Cognite Data Fusion are authenticated as submitted by a user using OAuth2 tokens.

Once a token is validated and the associated Cognite Data Fusion user is determined, [authorization](authorization.md) takes place.

## Tokens

When a user logs in through a web browser, they're sent to the identity provider (IdP) configured for the project (an OAuth2 provider, almost always Azure AD or Google) using the authorization code grant flow. See [external application integration](external-application.md).

Adding an `Authorization` header with the token as follows will authenticate the request:

```sh
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.cognitedata.com/api/v1/token/inspect' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ewogICJhbGciOiAiUlMyNTYiLAogICJ0eXAiOiAiSldUIgp9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.TCYt5XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVkIEq_PbChOMqsLfRoPsnsgw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgRxD-WUcX16dUEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qktb3rk-BuQy72IFLOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPN25DGlcTwLtjPAYuNzVBAh4vGHSrQyHUdBBPM'
```
