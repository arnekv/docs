Follow the [development quickstart](./quickstart/) to get up and running with Cognite Data Fusion in a few simple steps. And don't worry if you don't have your own project and data yet. You can use an API key and data from the [Open Industrial Data project](http://openindustrialdata.com) - a live industrial data stream - to **start learning**.
