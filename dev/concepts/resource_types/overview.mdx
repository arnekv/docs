<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Assets" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/assets" icon="cube">
    Store digital representations of physical objects or groups, organized in hierarchies. Assets connect related data from different sources and are core to contextualization in CDF.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time series" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/timeseries" icon="chart-line">
    Store a series of data points in time order, such as sensor readings or measurements. Useful for tracking changes and trends over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Events" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/events" icon="calendar">
    Store information about things that happen over a period, with start and end times. Events can be related to multiple assets and describe activities like maintenance or inspections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Files" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/files" icon="file">
    Store documents and files related to one or more assets, such as diagrams or reports. Files help centralize and contextualize documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3D models" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/3dmodels" icon="cube-3d">
    Store files that provide visual and geometrical context to assets. 3D models help visualize asset data and their placement in a facility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sequences" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/sequences" icon="table">
    Store a series of rows indexed by row number, with one or more columns of data. Useful for logs, performance curves, and tabular data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Labels" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/labels" icon="tag">
    Create managed terms to annotate and group assets. Labels make it easier to organize and find resources based on business logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relationships" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/relationships" icon="link">
    Represent connections between resource objects in CDF, defined by type and source/target. Relationships help model how resources are linked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAW" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/raw" icon="database">
    Use as a staging area to ingest data in its original form. RAW reduces source system queries and simplifies data transformation workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Entity matching" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/entity_matching" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Match entities like time series, files, and sequences from different sources to assets. Enables unified views and cross-system applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Templates" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/templates" icon="layer-group">
    Represent solutions' data models and connect them with data in CDF. Templates help standardize and manage solution-specific schemas.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Geospatial" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/geospatial" icon="map">
    Represent and manage data with geospatial properties, grouped into feature types. Useful for modeling and analyzing spatial data in CDF.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Seismic" href="/dev/concepts/resource_types/seismic" icon="waveform-lines">
    Catalog and access seismic data volumes for exploration and subsurface field development. Supports geologists and data managers in CDF.
  </Card>
